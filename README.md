# Receipt Printer (Python)

Welcome to my second beginner Python project!  
This is a simple receipt printing program that takes item names, prices, and quantities from the user, then prints a neatly formatted receipt.

---

# What It Does

- Asks the user to enter items one by one
- Takes **price** and **quantity** for each item
- Calculates total price per item (price Ã— quantity)
- Displays a cleanly formatted receipt with:
  - Item numbers
  - Quantity
  - Unit price
  - Total per item
  - Final total bill

---

# How To Use

1. Run the script in your terminal or any Python IDE.
2. Enter item names when prompted.
3. Enter the price and quantity for each item.
4. Type `'done'` when you're finished.
5. View the printed receipt with all totals aligned.

# What I Learned

- How to use **loops and lists** to store dynamic input
- How to format output using **f-strings**
- How to calculate totals and align values nicely
- Working with **strings, floats, and integers** together

# What's Next

In future updates, I might:
- Add support for discounts or taxes
- Allow deleting/editing items
- Save the receipt as a `.txt` file
- Build a GUI using Tkinter
